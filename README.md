# CODSOFT Task 2 - Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a data analysis project completed as part of the CODSOFT internship task. The focus of this task is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a given dataset to extract meaningful insights, visualize patterns, and prepare the data for potential modeling.

## Objectives

- Understand and explore the dataset
- Clean and preprocess data for analysis
- Visualize key statistics and trends
- Derive insights that could inform business or data-driven decisions

## Features

- Data cleaning and handling of missing values
- Summary statistics and correlation analysis
- Graphical representation of key variables and distributions
- Step-by-step explanation in Jupyter Notebook format

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data processing
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for execution and documentation

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sneha280904/CODSOFT-task2.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CODSOFT-task2
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Run the notebook to view the complete analysis and visual insights.

## Outcome

- Enhanced understanding of data through visualization
- Clear summary of data trends and relationships
- Cleaned dataset ready for further machine learning or business use
